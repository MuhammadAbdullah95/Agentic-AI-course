### Fundamentals of Agentic AI - From Foundations to Autonomous Agents

Agentic AI Course we cover All modules from week 1 to week 10.

Kickstart your journey into Agentic AI! This course provides a rapid yet comprehensive introduction to Conversational, Generative, and Agentic AI. You'll master the foundational concepts using **OpenAI Agents SDK**, then immediately build practical Conversational AI applications to understand human-AI interaction firsthand. The focus quickly shifts to Agentic Design Patterns, which you'll implement using OpenAI Agents SDK to create truly autonomous AI agents. You'll become proficient with OpenAI Agents SDK, developing agents ready for real-world tasks. Furthermore, you'll gain the unique skills to construct Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and agents, enabling you to build next-generation augmented LLMs. Finally, we'll explore the groundbreaking potential of Agentic Payments, envisioning the future of AI in finance.
