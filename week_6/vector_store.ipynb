    "# Exercise: Build a RAG-Based Resume Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows a student to chat with their own resume or profile. You will use the same tools and code structure as demonstrated in this notebook, adapting it to work with your own resume data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a chatbot that can answer questions about your resume or profile by retrieving relevant information and generating responses using a language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prepare Your Resume/Profile Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your resume or profile as a list of text sections (e.g., Education, Experience, Skills, Projects).\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    resume_sections = [\n",
    "        \"Education: B.Sc. in Computer Science from XYZ University, 2021.\",\n",
    "        \"Experience: Software Engineering Intern at ABC Corp, Summer 2020.\",\n",
    "        \"Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, SQL.\",\n",
    "        \"Projects: Built a personal finance tracker app using Flask and SQLite.\"\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Initialize ChromaDB and Create a Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the existing ChromaDB client to create a new collection for your resume.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    resume_collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name=\"student_resume\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generate Embeddings for Each Section\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Gemini embedding model to generate embeddings for each section.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    resume_embeddings_response = client.models.embed_content(\n",
    "        model=embed_model,\n",
    "        contents=resume_sections,\n",
    "        config=EmbedContentConfig(taskType=\"RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    resume_embeddings = [emb.values for emb in resume_embeddings_response.embeddings]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Add Sections and Embeddings to the Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add your resume sections and their embeddings to the ChromaDB collection.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    resume_collection.add(\n",
    "        documents=resume_sections,\n",
    "        embeddings=resume_embeddings,\n",
    "        ids=[f\"section{i+1}\" for i in range(len(resume_sections))]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Ask Questions About Your Resume\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a question you want to ask about your resume.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    question = \"What projects have I worked on?\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate an embedding for your question.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    question_embedding_response = client.models.embed_content(\n",
    "        model=embed_model,\n",
    "        contents=[question],\n",
    "        config=EmbedContentConfig(taskType=\"RETRIEVAL_QUERY\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    question_embedding = question_embedding_response.embeddings[0].values\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query the collection to retrieve relevant sections.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    result = resume_collection.query(\n",
    "        query_embeddings=[question_embedding],\n",
    "        n_results=2,\n",

    "    )\n",
    "    retrieved_sections = result['documents'][0]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Construct a Prompt and Get an Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a prompt using the retrieved sections and your question.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    context = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_sections)\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"Use the following context to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Context:\n",
    "    {context}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question:\n",
    "    {question}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer the question using only the information from the context above.\"\"\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate an answer using the Gemini model.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    response = client.models.generate_content(\n",
    "        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\", contents=prompt\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    print(response.text)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add more sections or details to your resume for richer responses.\n",
    "- Try asking different types of questions (e.g., about skills, education, experience).\n",
    "- Experiment with the number of results (`n_results`) to see how it affects the chatbot's answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this exercise, you will learn how to build a personalized RAG-based chatbot that can answer questions about your own resume or profile using retrieval and generation techniques!"
