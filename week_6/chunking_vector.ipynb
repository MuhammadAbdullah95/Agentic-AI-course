    "\n",
    "## Techniques Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Rule-Based Chunking\n",
    "- **Tool Used:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain_text_splitters`\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "    - `chunk_size=500`: Each chunk contains up to 500 characters.\n",

      "What is Artificial Intelligence?\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "History of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times, but the modern field of AI research was founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College. The term \"artificial intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy, a computer scientist who organized the conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early AI research focused on symbolic methods and problem-solving. In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers developed expert systems that could mimic human decision-making in specific domains. However, these systems were limited by their inability to handle uncertainty and their reliance on hand-coded rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1980s saw the rise of machine learning approaches, which could automatically learn patterns from data. This period also witnessed the development of neural networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "AI can be categorized into three main types:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Narrow AI (Weak AI): This is AI that is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or internet searches. Most AI systems today fall into this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. General AI (Strong AI): This would be AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to human intelligence. This type of AI does not currently exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Superintelligent AI: This would be AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. This is a theoretical concept that may or may not be achievable in the future.\n",

      "- Association rule learning: Finding relationships between variables\n",
      "\n",
      "Common unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).\n",
      "\n",
      "Reinforcement Learning:\n",
      "Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable actions to maximize reward in a particular situation. It employs trial and error to learn optimal actions. The algorithm learns through interaction with an environment and receives rewards or penalties based on its actions.\n",

      "What is Artificial Intelligence?\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chunk 4: CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - History of AI**\n",
      "History of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times, but the modern field of AI research was founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College. The term \"artificial intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy, a computer scientist who organized the conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early AI research focused on symbolic methods and problem-solving. In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers developed expert systems that could mimic human decision-making in specific domains. However, these systems were limited by their inability to handle uncertainty and their reliance on hand-coded rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1980s saw the rise of machine learning approaches, which could automatically learn patterns from data. This period also witnessed the development of neural networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chunk 5: CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Types of AI**\n",
      "Types of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "AI can be categorized into three main types:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Narrow AI (Weak AI): This is AI that is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or internet searches. Most AI systems today fall into this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. General AI (Strong AI): This would be AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to human intelligence. This type of AI does not currently exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Superintelligent AI: This would be AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. This is a theoretical concept that may or may not be achievable in the future.\n",

      "**Chunk 7: CHAPTER 2: MACHINE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS - Types of Machine Learning**\n",
      "Types of Machine Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three primary types of machine learning:\n",
      "\n",
      "Supervised Learning:\n",
      "In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data. The algorithm learns to map inputs to correct outputs based on example input-output pairs. Common examples include:\n",

      "\n",
      "Unsupervised Learning:\n",
      "Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns in data without labeled examples. The algorithm must find structure in the input data on its own. Common examples include:\n",

      "Artificial intelligence represents one of the most transformative technologies of our time. From its theoretical foundations to practical applications across industries, AI continues to evolve and reshape how we live, work, and interact with technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey from narrow AI systems that perform specific tasks to the potential development of artificial general intelligence represents both tremendous opportunities and significant challenges. As we advance in this field, it's essential to maintain a balance between innovation and responsibility, ensuring that AI development serves humanity's best interests while addressing ethical concerns and potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The future of AI will likely be characterized by increased human-AI collaboration, more sophisticated and capable systems, and the need for robust governance frameworks to guide development and deployment. By understanding these technologies and their implications, we can better prepare for a future where artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "As researchers, developers, policymakers, and citizens, we all have a role to play in shaping the future of AI. Through continued research, ethical development practices, and thoughtful regulation, we can work toward realizing the full potential of artificial intelligence while minimizing its risks and ensuring its benefits are shared broadly across society.\n",
