    "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval systems and large language models (LLMs) to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How RAG Works:**\n",
    "1. **User Prompt:** The user asks a question or provides a prompt.\n",
    "2. **Retrieval (R):** The RAG system searches a knowledge base or external documents to retrieve relevant information related to the prompt.\n",
    "3. **Augmentation (A):** The retrieved information is combined with the original prompt to create an augmented prompt.\n",
    "4. **Generation (G):** The augmented prompt is passed to a language model (LLM), which generates a response using both the user’s question and the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures that the LLM has access to up-to-date and specific information, leading to more informed and accurate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Illustrated in the Diagram:**  \n",
    "![Simple RAG Architecture](RAG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Prompt:** \"Why are hotels in Vancouver super expensive this weekend?\"\n",
    "- **RAG System:** Retrieves relevant information (e.g., a major event like a Taylor Swift concert).\n",
    "- **Augmented Prompt:** Combines the user’s question with the retrieved event details.\n",
    "- **LLM Response:** Provides an answer that explains the price surge due to the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging retrieval and generation together, RAG systems can overcome the limitations of LLMs that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, making them more powerful and adaptable for real-world applications."
