# 📘 Week 1: Python Basics and Environment Setup

Welcome to **Week 1** of the Agentic AI course!
In this week, we lay the foundation by setting up your Python development environment and diving into basic programming concepts essential for building intelligent agents in later weeks.

## 🔍 Introduction

### What is a Programming Language?
A **programming language** is a structured method for communicating instructions to a computer. It is used to create software programs and automate processes. Programming languages allow humans to define rules, logic, and workflows that computers can execute.

### Why Python?
Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages in the world. It is known for:
- Simple and readable syntax
- Large community and support
- Versatility: used in web development, AI/ML, data science, scripting, and automation
- Strong libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Flask, TensorFlow)
- Cross-platform compatibility

Python is especially useful in **Agentic AI** due to seamless integration with AI toolkits, APIs, and environments.

### Common Uses of Python
- Web Development
- Data Analysis & Visualization
- Machine Learning & AI
- Automation & Scripting
- Game Development

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🐍 Python Installation
* Installation guide for:
  * Windows
  * macOS
  * Linux
* Verifying installation using terminal/command prompt

#### ✅ Installation Check Commands
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```
If `python` is not recognized, try using `python3`.

---

### 🧰 IDEs for Python Development
* IDEs we explored:
  * VS Code
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * Cursor AI
  * Google Colab (browser-based)

Each IDE offers features like debugging, code suggestions, and notebook scripting for different workflows.

---

### 🧾 Print Statements and Strings
* Use of `print()` to display output
* Representing strings using:
  * Single quotes `'Hello'`
  * Double quotes `"Hello"`
  * Triple quotes `'''Hello'''` for multi-line strings

### 💬 Comments in Python
* Single-line comments using `#`
* Multi-line comments using triple quotes `'''` or `"""`

---

### 🔤 Variables, Data Types & Type Conversion
* Declaring variables
* Built-in types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* Dynamic typing
* Type casting using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`

---

### 🖥️ Input/Output & Operators
* Reading user input with `input()`
* Output with `print()`
* Operators:
  * Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  * Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`
  * Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

---

### 🔁 Control Flow (if/else)
* Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision making
* Indentation rules
* Writing nested conditions

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Exercises

### ✅ Simple Calculator
* A program that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input.

### ✅ Grade Evaluator
* A program that evaluates a student's grade based on marks using conditional statements.

- Set up and configure Python on your system
- Choose an appropriate IDE for your workflow
- Understand and use basic Python syntax and structures
- Use input, output, and variables
- Apply control flow logic with `if`/`else`
