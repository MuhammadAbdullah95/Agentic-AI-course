# 📘 Week 1: Python Basics and Environment Setup

Welcome to **Week 1** of the Agentic AI course!
In this week, we lay the foundation by setting up your Python development environment and diving into basic programming concepts essential for building intelligent agents in later weeks.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🐍 Python Installation

* Step-by-step installation guide for:

  * **Windows**
  * **macOS**
  * **Linux**
* Verifying Python installation using the terminal or command prompt.
* Setting up `python` and `pip` environment variables.

---

### 🧰 IDEs for Python Development

* Overview and usage of different Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):

  * **VS Code**
  * **Jupyter Notebook**
  * **Cursor AI**
  * **Google Colab** (for browser-based execution)

Each IDE offers unique features like code completion, debugging, and notebook-style scripting for different development needs.

---

### 🔤 Variables, Data Types & Type Conversion

* Creating and naming variables
* Built-in data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* Dynamic typing in Python
* Type casting: converting between types using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.

---

### 🖥️ Input/Output & Operators

* Reading input from users using `input()`
* Displaying output with `print()`
* Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators:

  * `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `and`, `or`, `not`

---

### 🔁 Control Flow (if/else)

* Making decisions using:

  * `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
* Indentation rules in Python
* Nesting conditions and writing clean logic

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Exercises

### ✅ **Simple Calculator**

* A command-line tool that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) based on user input.

### ✅ **Grade Evaluator**

* A program that takes marks as input and outputs a grade based on the defined grading scale using if/else conditions.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

* Set up and configure Python on your system
* Choose an appropriate IDE for your workflow
* Understand and use basic Python syntax and structures
* Write simple, interactive programs using input, output, variables, and control flow
